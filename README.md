## Idea Description ##

Do you want to switch over from Windows to a new operating system? Do you have doubts over whether you will be able to migrate over successfully to the new OS? Well we provide a solution. Our idea is to give every person a session to experience the basic functionalities of the new os that they want to try. In this project, the theme we have based the os on is Ubuntu 18.04, as it is one of the most popular OS's apart from Windows.
Each session will. enable the user to experience the basic functionalities and applications present in the new OS, which include:
1. File Manager (uploading and viewing files)
2. Terminal (for Ubuntu)
3. Utility software : Google Search, Calculator, PDF Viewer, text Editor
4. Multimedia : Music Player, Minesweeper

All in all, we aim to provide the user with a small 'preview' of what he/she can expect from the GUI of the new OS.

## Tools and Technology ##

The sessions is a modeled desktop environment, implemented via Jquery and Javascript. Hosting the session and the backend of the whole project has been implemennted using NodeJS

The Linux terminal has been implemented using the Node Package Manager (NPM). 
The interactive environment has been integrated with various smoth features, using CSS animations and Jquery.

## How to RUN the Application ##

To get started, you need the Node server running locally. For that, you need to:

1. Clone this repo
2. npm install to install all required dependencies ( Make sure that NodeJs is installed )
3. Use 'npm run start' to start a local server on PORT 3000
4. Use 'npm run dev' to start the local server in nodemon environment on same PORT. 

## Application and Scope  ##

Our main purpose for implementing the project using NodeJS is that we want every user to find it as easy as possible to access our application. Installing NodeJS is very simple and it takes almost no effort in installing it and running the application.

This project is aimed at anyone who is trying to/ thinking about switching over from Windows. This includes school kids, college students, even servicemen, who have a taste for tech and development. Everyone has their qualms before taking such a huge step, that is installing and switching over to a completely new environment. We want to help people forego of their doubts and switch over with a new found confidence. After all, if they have used our application, they will have a pretty good idea of what to expect !!
